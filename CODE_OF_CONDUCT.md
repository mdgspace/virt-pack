# Code of Conduct
## Our Commitment

As members and contributors, we commit to fostering a community where everyone can participate in a safe, respectful, and harassment-free environment. This applies to people of all ages, body types, visible and invisible disabilities, ethnicities, sex characteristics, gender identities and expressions, levels of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationalities, appearances, races, castes, colors, religions, or sexual orientations.

## Community Standards

Positive behaviors that strengthen our community include:

* Showing empathy, patience, and kindness to others
* Respecting differing opinions, experiences, and perspectives
* Offering and receiving constructive feedback gracefully
* Taking responsibility, apologizing when mistakes are made, and learning from them
* Prioritizing the well-being and growth of the community over individual interests

Unacceptable behaviors include:

* Sexualized language, imagery, or unwelcome advances
* Trolling, insults, derogatory remarks, or personal/political attacks
* Harassment in any form (public or private)
* Sharing someoneâ€™s private information (e.g., physical address, email) without consent
* Any other conduct that would reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional or community setting

## Member's Responsibilities

Members of the organisation are accountable for upholding and enforcing these standards.
Admins are empowered to remove, edit, or reject contributions (e.g., comments, commits, issues, wiki edits) that violate this Code of Conduct and will explain their decisions where appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies across all community spaces and when an individual is officially representing the community in public forums.
